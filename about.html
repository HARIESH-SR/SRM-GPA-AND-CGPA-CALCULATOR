            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Hello! We are Sai Narayana and Hariesh, the creators of the SRM IST GPA & CGPA Calculator.</p>

            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>We are students pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the batch of 2021-2025 at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRM IST), Trichy Campus. With a passion for simplifying the academic journey, we embarked on this project together.</p>

            <h2>Why We Built This Website</h2>
            <p>We understand the challenges that students face when it comes to calculating their GPA and CGPA. Many online tools are available, but they often require entering subject credit details and total semester credits, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome.</p>
            <p>To overcome this issue, we decided to build our website. Our goal was to create a user-friendly tool that enables students to calculate their GPA and CGPA without the hassle of entering credit details.</p>

            <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preloaded Courses:</strong> Our website currently features courses available at SRM IST, Trichy Campus. We've eliminated the need for students to manually enter course details.</li>
                <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> With just a few clicks, students can select their regulation, course, semester, and grades to calculate their GPA and CGPA.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>While we've started with courses available in our Trichy campus, we have plans to expand our offerings. In the future, we aim to include courses available in other SRM IST campuses, making it even more convenient for students across the university.</p>

            <p>Thank you for choosing the SRM IST GPA & CGPA Calculator. We hope our tool simplifies your academic journey and helps you achieve your goals.</p>
